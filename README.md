# Revershell
Window 10 - 11 Undetectable Reverse Shell
The reverse shell demonstrated in this article is undetectable to any type of antivirus, that is, once the connection is established, no antivirus detects anything wrong and not even the victim can notice any difference (unless there is some sniffer on the network, which is unlikely for casual users).

OK. Now that we know what a Reverse Shell is and how it works, letâ€™s get started. In case you have any form of code execution on a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine (remote or not) you can run this code in victim pc.

Where YOUR_IP is the IP of the attacker machine and PORT is the listening port. You can run the above exploit on the victim machine.
